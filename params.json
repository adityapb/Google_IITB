Only those links having '.iitb.ac.in' were considered.\r\n###Extracting keywords\r\nAll words from the url as well as title were used as keywords. Also to compensate for the lack of enough keywords, edged N-grams of these words were used.\r\n###Creating the database\r\nThe data was then arranged as 'keyword-list_of_links' table.<br>\r\nAlso pageranks were calculated using most primitive version of google's pageranking algorithm. [Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank)\r\n###Searching\r\nThe user input is split in words and a list of urls is retrieved from the data. The list is then sorted first according to their pageranks then according to the number of times that link appears in the list.<br><br>\r\n**The code for first 3 parts can be found in the [SearchEngine](https://github.com/adityapb/searchEngine) project.**\r\n##For setting up server\r\nThe server must have python, `pyenchant` module and `django:v1.7.4` installed<br>\r\nFor setting up in localhost, run `python manage.py runserver`\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
